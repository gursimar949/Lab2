# Lab2

# Time taken in Minutes: 120 minutes.

# Thoughts:

The assignment was a good introduction to the basics of coding and helped me understand all the basic data types, conditions and loops.
Ternary operator was one of the most interesting conditions.

# Difficulties:

1. Understanding how to take in the program arguments.
2. Use of break or return in switch case.
3. Comparing while and do while loop.

# Insights:

1. Found out that char can also be a number. char c = 1;
2. The test cases might look for index out of bond exceptions in case the array ends before the sum to 50.
3. The main class in the same folder can use the methods in the other classes.

Thank you.
